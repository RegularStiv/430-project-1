# Server Connect Four
project 1 for igme 430. 

Uses Node.js to create a playable connect four game between many people at the same time using a lobby system.

Client Files are the files each users sees while they play back and forth like Style sheets, and the board.

SRC Files are the files only seen by the server which it uses to pass information back and forth between players.

Deployed on Heroku to be used online here: https://young-river-08788.herokuapp.com/
